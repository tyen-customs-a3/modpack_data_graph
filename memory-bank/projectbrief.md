# File Size Visualization

## Project Overview
A web-based visualization tool that displays file and directory sizes in both treemap and circle packing formats. The tool helps users understand disk space usage through hierarchical, color-coded visualizations.

## Core Requirements
1. Multiple visualization options:
   - Interactive treemap
   - Circle packing layout
2. Common features for both visualizations:
   - Depth control for exploring the directory hierarchy
   - Label visibility control
   - Responsive design that adapts to window size
   - Color-coded blocks/circles based on directory depth
   - Size information displayed in human-readable format

## Technical Goals
1. Clean, modular code structure (HTML, CSS, JS separation)
2. Efficient data handling and visualization
3. Smooth user interactions
4. Clear visual hierarchy
5. Intuitive controls
6. Consistent styling across visualization types

## Success Criteria
1. Visualizations accurately represent file/directory sizes
2. Smooth performance with large directory structures
3. Intuitive user interface
4. Clear visual feedback for user actions
5. Responsive and accessible design
6. Consistent user experience across visualization types
