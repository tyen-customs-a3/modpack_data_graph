# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Refining the circle packing visualization for file size analysis
- Improving UI consistency and compactness
- Managing directory visibility in the visualization
- Enhancing user interaction feedback

## Recent Changes
1. Directory Visibility Control
   - Implemented ctrl+click to toggle directory visibility
   - Added reset and invert visibility buttons
   - Limited visibility toggling to second-level directories only
   - Fixed data structure to properly handle directory visibility

2. UI Improvements
   - Standardized font sizes for better consistency
   - Implemented more compact layout
   - Added control legend in visualization panel
   - Improved spacing and padding throughout
   - Enhanced visual hierarchy with consistent sizing

3. Font Size Standardization
   - Base: 12px
   - Headers: 13px
   - Main text: 11px
   - Secondary text: 10px
   - Smallest text: 8-9px

## Active Decisions
1. Visualization Layout
   - Using circle packing for hierarchical representation
   - Depth slider for controlling visualization complexity
   - Color scheme based on depth using d3.interpolateMagma
   - Directory visibility control through sidebar and ctrl+click

2. Information Display
   - Hierarchical file list in side panel
   - Size information in MB for consistency
   - Full path display in tooltips
   - Visual hierarchy through indentation
   - Compact, consistent typography

3. User Interface
   - Resizable side panels for flexible layout
   - Minimum width constraints for usability
   - Visual feedback for interactions
   - Consistent styling across components
   - Control legend for user guidance

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding:
   - Search/filter functionality for files
   - Export capabilities for file lists
   - Additional visualization options
   - Custom color scheme selection
   - File type-based coloring

2. Potential Improvements:
   - Performance optimization for large directories
   - Enhanced file list navigation
   - Additional file metadata display
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Save/load visualization preferences
