# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Developers and system administrators often need to understand the size distribution of files in their projects or systems. Traditional file explorers provide basic size information but lack an intuitive way to visualize the hierarchical structure and relative sizes of files and directories.

## Solution
The File Size Treemap Visualizer provides an interactive visualization that:
1. Shows the relative sizes of files and directories in a hierarchical treemap
2. Allows users to explore the directory structure at different depths
3. Provides immediate visual feedback about file size distribution
4. Enables quick identification of large files and directories

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Exploration**
   - Users can quickly understand the size distribution
   - Interactive controls are immediately understandable
   - Visual hierarchy clearly represents directory structure

2. **Efficient Analysis**
   - Quick identification of large files
   - Easy navigation through directory levels
   - Clear size representation through area and color

3. **Portable Sharing**
   - Self-contained HTML output
   - No server requirements
   - Easy to share with team members

## Key Features
1. **Directory Scanning**
   - Recursive scanning of file systems
   - Support for file extension filtering
   - Accurate size calculation

2. **Interactive Visualization**
   - Adjustable depth view
   - File visibility toggle
   - Interactive tooltips
   - Color-coded directories

3. **Data Presentation**
   - Clear file and directory labels
   - Size-based area representation
   - Hierarchical structure visualization
   - Detailed tooltips with paths and sizes

## Target Users
